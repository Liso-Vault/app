## About The Project
Liso uses a powerful decentralized network of computers (Sia) to route your vault & files, making it impossible for anyone to leak your data. And with Sia's protocols, your files are broken into 30 pieces, each of which is encrypted and only you can decrypt them.

Zero-Knowledge: No phone number or email is needed to create a Liso Vault
Decentralized: Makes data breaches and central point of failures a thing of the past
No-Logging: Liso doesn't store, track, or log your data
Open-source: Check Liso's code yourself
Offline Mode: You have the choice to use the app 100% offline
Cross Platform: Supports most platforms

## About The Project
Liso uses a powerful decentralized network of computers to route your files, making it impossible for anyone to leak or sell your data. You have the option to choose your provider: IPFS, Sia, Storj, and Skynet.

Zero-Knowledge: No phone number or email is needed to create a Liso Vault
Decentralized: Makes data breaches and central point of failures a thing of the past
No-Logging: Liso doesn't store, track, or log your data
Open-source: Check Liso's code yourself
Offline Mode: You have the choice to use the app 100% offline

## Open-source Status
The current state of Liso being open-source is for self-auditing purposes only. This means some code are not included as they contain `secrets` proprietory for Liso as a business, in result you will be unable to successfully build the source.
